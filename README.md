# Object Oriented CSS

This is an update to the previous work to re-organize the CSS. SMACCS was used.

This uses the Skeleton Grid system to display a mosaic of students in the August 2014 bootcamp class of Code Fellows. Scroll to the bottom to see the mosaic.

In addition, JS was used to dynamically create the HTML contents of the mosaic and fitting it together.
